  <p>Note: Infested stacks will not be a thing for normal. Neither will the tail swipe.</p>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>

  <h3>Phase 1 ("Plagued Dreamer")</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Roughly 90 seconds long.</li>
    <li>Nythendra attacks the party until she runs out of energy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Infested Ground</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pools on the ground, created by most of Nythendra's abilities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don't stand in it.</p>

  <h4>Rot</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Debuff placed on random players</li>
    <li>Occurs roughly every 15 seconds</li>
    <li>Lasts 9 seconds. For the duration, deals periodic damage to all allies within 8 years of the afflicted player.</li>
    <li>When Rot expires, a pool of Infested Ground will be left on the ground beaneath the afflicted player.</li>
    <li>This mechanic is part of the soft enrage and will affect more players as the fight goes on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>My speculation: Players should be relatively spread out so when Rot goes out, damage is not crazy. Probably don't necessarily need to be 8 yards apart but shouldn't have more than another person or two near you probably. I don't know how easy it will be to spread out with 30 people within 1/4 of the room.</i></p>
  <p>Afflicted players must get out of the ground and go to the edge of the room by the time their debuff expires.</p>
  <p>We want to drop Rot in the current quadrant we're in (more under Infested Breath) so don't run too far away. Just get to the edge of the room.</p>

  <h4>Volatile Rot</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Debuff which is cast on Nythendra's current tank.</li>
    <li>Will occur roughly 3 times per Phase 1</li>
    <li>Lasts for 8 seconds - has no effect until it expires</li>
    <li>When the debuff expires, Volatile Rot causes an explosion damaging the entire raid. It inflicts more damage the closer you are to the center (the tank)</li>
    <li>When the debuff expires, Volatile Rot will also leave 3 Infested Ground pools near the tank.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Assign a place for Volatile Rot to be dropped that will be used throughout the fight which will be some distance from the boss (so it is not so close to the raid that it will get people killed when it detonates).</p>
  <p>When a tank is affected by Volatile Rot, the other tank should taunt. As soon as the other tank has taunted, the afflicted tank should move to the assigned location.</p>
  <p>The afflicted tank will always take full damage from the blast, so it's a good opportunity to use a cooldown.</p>

  <h4>Infested Breath</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the ability that controls Nythendra's Phase 1 to Phase 2 transition. Each cast consumes 50 energy. Transition to Phase 2 will happen after the second cast.</li>
    <li>Infested Breath will be targeted at a random raid member.</li>
    <li>Cone shape damage dealt over a 5 second channel</li>
    <li>Patches of Infested Ground will appear within the damaged cone area</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Run out of the affected area.</p>
  <p>We'll have 4 quadrants. Players will start in one, dropping Rot toward the edge of the room and clumped together for Breath. After the first Breath, will move to another quadrant.</p>
  <p>After the second breath, players will move to the other half of the room, which should be completely clear of Infested Ground.</p>
  <p>Players should be around melee range (but still spread out for Rot) so they can more easily escape the affected area. After each breath, the raid should move as a unit in the same direction (either clockwise or counterclockwise).</p>
  <p>The 2nd Infested Breath (near end of Phase 1) will coincide with the 3rd Volatile Rot on the tank, so this can be a good time to use healer cooldowns due to heavy raid damage.</p>
  <p>Ideally during phase 1 we'll keep half the room clear and concentrate the Infested Ground in the other half, so phase 2 will have half the room clear, making it easier to see bugs etc.</p>


  <h3>Phase 2 ("Heart of the Swarm")</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Begins when Nythendra reaches 0 energy.</li>
    <li>Boss no longer directly attacks group</li>
    <li>Room fills with tiny bugs (they don't do anything yet)</li>
    <li>Boss behinds to absorb Infested Ground. Infested Ground will travel toward the boss</li>
    <li>Lasts approximately 20 seconds</li>
    <li>When energy is full, go back to Phase 1</li>
    <li>After each Phase 2, 1 additional player will be affected by Rot per cast.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Infested Ground</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pools of Infested Ground from phase 1 will be drawn toward Nythendra.</li>
    <li>Infested Ground has the same effects as before (deals damage to anyone standing inside), it's just now moving toward the boss instead of being stationary</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players should not stand in the path of Infested Ground.</p>
  <p>Ideally Infested Ground has been placed around the room such that there are completely clear areas for players to stand, so they only have to worry about dodging bugs and not Infested Ground.</p>

  <h4>Corrupted Vermin</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Periodically, a handful of insects will grow and become Corrupted Vermin</li>
    <li>Fully grown insects will cast Burst of Corruption 3 times, dealing damage to players within 8 yards</li>
    <li>Players struck by Burst of Corruption will get a debuff that increases the damage they take from subsequent Bursts of Corruption</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players should watch for insects that begin to grow and get away from them before they burst.</p>

  <h3>Enrage?</h3>
  <p>There's no enrage, but each Heart of the Swarm phase will cause the next Plagued Dreamer phase to be a little more difficult, acting as a soft enrage.</p>

  <h1>Elerethe</h1>

  </figure>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>

  <p>Elerethe will switch between forms each time her energy bar fills up.</p>

  <h3>Throughout the fight</h3>
  <h4>Pulsing Egg Sacs</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Getting too close will cause Violent Rupture, dealing damage and knocking players back</li>
    <li>Spiderlings will spawn from ruptured egg sacs and attack nearby players</li>
    <li>These spiderlings do not create venomous pools when they die</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Try not to step on them. If they are stepped on, tanks should try to pick up the spiderlings and healers should top off those who were damaged by the rupture.</p>

  <h4>Web Bridges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Each player stepping on a bridge will spawn a Venomous Spiderling</li>
    <li>Must travel along these (and spawn a spiderling) when Elerethe changes platforms</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don't get on the web bridge unless it's during the Interlude. Don't stand in pools.</p>

  <h4>Venomous Spiderling</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Stacks a dot on the tank (high dmg) and creates venomous pools when they die. Venomous pools can stack on top of each other and be deceptively high damage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Offtank will pick these up and should make sure to get them out of the raid before they die. Ideally we want them to be in a place where they will not be in the path the raid has to run to get to a web bridge.</p>

  <h3>Phase 1 (Spider)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lasts 90 seconds</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Web of Pain</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Links 2 players together.</li>
    <li>Lasts 90 seconds</li>
    <li>Always hits 2 tanks. Second web of pain will hit two random non-tanks.</li>
    <li>Causes linked players to reflect damage to their partner</li>
    <li>100% of damage is transferred when players are within 20 yards. If players are not within 20 yards of each other, it will deal more damage!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Linked players should stand close together to keep damage down.</p>

  <h4>Necrotic Venom</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Targets 2 random non-tank players and draws 7 yd radius around players feet</li>
    <li>This debuff does nothing for the first 10 seconds. After first 10 seconds, get new debuff that lasts 6 seconds.</li>
    <li>6 second debuff will deal damage to the target every second and to players within the 7 yard radius</li>
    <li>Affected player will drop Venomous Pool at their feet immediately and every second until debuff expires</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During the warning debuff, move away from the raid toward the edge of the platform.</p>
  <p>During the real debuff, use a defensive cooldown and keep moving to avoid standing in pools.</p>
  <p>Be careful not to drop pools in the raid's path between platforms</p>
  <p>Players with this debuff will need additional healing</p>

  <h4>Vile Ambush</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2x per spider phase, Elerethe retreats and summons Venomous Spiderlings</li>
    <li>The location of a random ranged character will be marked with an impact point</li>
    <li>After 8 seconds, she drops back down at the chosen impact point, damaging all players. Players further from impact suffer less damage. Players inside impact point may die and will be knocked back.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tanks should be tanking spider form Elerethe at one side of the platform. Ideally at the end of spider phase you'd like her to be near the next platform she'll travel to. (Is this always the same platform?)</p>
  <p>When Elerethe retreats and the impact point is chosen, players should run to opposite side of platform. The idea is for each Vile Ambush you'll just swap positions.</p>
  <p>Tanks need to pick up the spiderlings as they land.</p>
  <p>Healers should use raid cooldowns to heal Vile Ambush damage.</p>

  <h3>Phase 2 (Roc)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lasts 2 minutes</li>
    <li>Elerethe turns into a bird</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Twisting Shadows</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Similar to Necrotic Venom - 10 second warning debuff to start</li>
    <li>During warning debuff, players are immune to Venomous Pools and they can destroy Venomous Pools by running over them</li>
    <li>When debuff wears off, a tornado spawns at the player's location. Tornadoes will wander in the area they were dropped.</li>
    <li>Players who are struck by a tornado will be stunned, take periodic damage, and will be thrown. They may take falling damage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players should absorb Venomous Pools to clean up platform</p>
  <p>Drop tornadoes away from the path to the next platform in a safe place.</p>

  <h4>Gathering Clouds</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Deals raid-wide damage and pushes players back</li>
    <li>After it completes, Elerethe will fly to the next platform</li>
    <li>Elerethe flying to new platform begins the Interlude phase</li>
    <li>Elerethe drops Shimmering Feathers on the ground after taking off</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Avoid being pushed into venomous pools, twisting shadows, egg sacs, or off the edge. If possible stand with your back to the wall to avoid pushback and continue to heal/dps.</p>
  <p>Good time to use raid wide damage reduction and healing cooldowns</p>

  <h3>"Interlude"</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Elerethe flies to a new platform</li>
    <li>Dark Storm debuff affects the two platforms Elerethe is not on</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Dark Storm</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Deals raidwide damage to anyone who is not on Elerethe's current platform</li>
    <li>Damage starts low and ramps up 5% per stack</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Get out of Dark Storm asap by getting to Elerethe's new platform.</p>
  <p>If you don't take a Shimmering Feather, this is a good time to use personal defensive cooldowns.</p>
  <p>Speed boosts can be useful but also deadly, use with caution</p>

  <h4>Web Bridges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Each player that crosses will spawn 1 spiderling</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Watch out for Twisting Shadows when crossing. You may need to drop to a lower web bridge to avoid them.</p>
  <p>Survival is more important than speed.</p>
  <p>Ground tank should pick up spiderlings and when they get to the other end of the bridge, should drag them away from the raid. Let's say after they get off bridge, they go to the right of the bridge.</p>
  <p>Be very careful not to trigger any egg sacs while crossing</p>

  <h4>Shimmering Feathers</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Each one can only be taken by 1 raid member</li>
    <li>Lasts 25 seconds</li>
    <li>Allows the player to leap into the sky and applies slow fall debuff so they can glide over gap between platforms</li>
    <li>Player can jump multiple times from the ground (but cannot jump while in midair)</li>
    <li>Grants extra action button that allows the player to target a spot on the ground to land, killing any Venomous Spiderlings in 9 yards</li>
  </ul>
  <p>1 tank, 1+ healers, and the rest DPS should be assigned to take feathers. They will jump directly to Elerethe's platform.</p>
  <p>Once on Elerethe's platform, when the offtank arrives with the spiders, DPS with feathers should focus on killing the Venomous Spiderlings. (Tank and healer will deal with boss)</p>
  <p>Note that spiderlings killed in this fashion still drop Venomous Pools, so don't block the raid's path across the bridge</p>

  <h3>Roc Form Still</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Elerethe will remain in this form until she reaches 100 energy, at which point she turns into a spider again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During this part of the fight, the tanks should slowly drag Elerethe across the platform to the other bridge in order to keep the raid away from tornadoes.</p>

  <h4>Raking Talons</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Cast 3 times, 33 seconds apart</li>
    <li>Each cast will involve 2 strikes of Raking talons, which will be 3 seconds apart</li>
    <li>If a tank is struck by both strikes in a single cast, second strike will deal 100% additional damage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tanks should taunt after the first strike of Raking Talons to avoid the stacking damage.</p>
  <p>Tanks should mitigate this damage with cooldowns or active mitigation</p>

  <h4>Razor Wing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Cast immediately after Raking Talons</li>
    <li>Deals damage in a cone in front of boss</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tanks should keep the boss pointed away from the raid. Melee and offtank should not stand in front of the boss.</p>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>

  <h3>Phase 1 ("The Ruined Ground")</h3>
  <p>Goal is to defeat the Eye of Il'gynoth in order to access the heart.</p>

  <h4>Nightmare Gaze</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Eye will target a random raid member. Cannot avoid, so just keep the raid topped up.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Adds</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Large adds (Tentacles &amp; Horror) need to be killed. When killed, they will spawn varying numbers of Nightmare Ichor (1-4 depending on the mob).</li>
    <li>Nightmare Ichor will fixate a random raid member</li>
    <li>When Nightmare Ichor is killed, its Nightmare Explosion will deal AoE damage around it after 2.5s. If within 15 yards of the Eye, will deal 5% of the Eye's health.</li>
    <li>Nightmare Ichor will apply a stack of Touch of Corruption on melee attacks. It can be dispeled but ideally we don't want the target being hit much</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fixated players should kite the Ichor to the Eye.</p>
  <p>DPS should switch to the Ichor and kill it when it is within 15 yards of the Eye</p>
  <p>Do not stun Ichor unless it's already in range of the Eye. Ichors can be slowed, particularly to help reduce their debuff stacks on their target.</p>
  <p>Get away from the Ichor before it explodes to avoid being damaged</p>
  <p>Need to kill 20 Nightmare Ichor near the Eye to enter Phase 2.</p>
  <p>When the eye is killed, no more adds will be spawned. Finish off the remaining adds before entering the heart chamber.</p>
  <p><strong>Ichor (in range) &gt; Tentacles &gt; Horror</strong></p>

  <h5>Dominator Tentacle</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Must be tanked and must have someone in melee range</li>
    <li>Deal heavy damage - use cooldowns or active mitigation to survive</li>
    <li>Will randomly target players for Ground Slam (typically melee). This effect is on the player, not on the ground. After 2 seconds, the attack hits.</li>
    <li>Ground Slam deals damage in a cone and knocks back</li>
    <li>On death, spawns 2 Nightmare Ichor.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We want to assign at least 1 melee to each Dominator Tentacle to make sure they are the ones targeted for Ground Slam. Can be difficult for ranged to escape it.</p>
  <p>If the target is near other players they need to get away from other players in their 2 seconds</p>

  <h5>Deathglare Tentacle</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Does not need to be tanked</li>
    <li>Randomly targets raid member with Mind Flay</li>
    <li>Can be interrupted and stunned</li>
    <li>Spawns 2 Nightmare Ichor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Low health players targeted with Mind Flay should use cooldowns</p>
  <p>Ideally we want to interrupt every cast</p>

  <h5>Nightmare Horror</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Must be tanked</li>
    <li>Every 10 seconds, casts Eye of Fate dealing damage in a straight line in front of the mob. Eye of Fate stacks.</li>
    <li>Spawns 4 Nightmare Ichor</li>
    <li>Creates Nightmare Corruption pools under its feet every 5 sec which causes damage and pacifies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tanks swap on 3 stacks of Eye of Fate. Tanks should use strong mitigation to survive the 3rd one. Tank facing away from the raid.</p>
  <p>Tank needs to move the Nightmare Horror away from the pools so melee won't stand in it</p>
  <p>Low priority kill target so can be good to keep near tentacles for cleave. Just don't drop nightmare corruption on the melee</p>

  <h5>Corruptor Tentacle</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Targets random non-tanks for Spew Corruption - deals instant damage and debuffs</li>
    <li>Debuff will deal periodic damage and create Nightmare Corruption beneath affected player's feet</li>
    <li>Spawns 1 Nightmare Ichor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players targeted should move to the outer edge, dropping all 4 pools before returning to the group.</p>
  <p>Try to drop pools so they overlap (pools will slowly grow), and stay in range of healers. Use damage reduction cooldown if possible.</p>
  <p>DO NOT be near the eye with your pools because that can screw over our ability to kill Ichor. If you are fixated, wait until your corruption debuff fades before kiting Ichor to boss</p>

  <h3>Phase 2 ("The Heart of Corruption")</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>(1st time) Players have 50 seconds to deal as much damage as possible to the heart. After 50 seconds are up, any players still in the heart chamber are insta-killed and we return to Phase 1.</li>
    <li>(2nd time) Players have 90 seconds to deal as much damage as possible to the heart. After 90 seconds are up, the raid will be wiped.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Plan to leave the chamber when about 5 seconds are left remaining on the cast. Earlier if you have lag issues.</p>
  <p>Use Heroism once people are inside and blow dps cooldowns.</p>
  <p>Nothing to tank so tanks can deal damage during this phase</p>

  <h4>Cursed Blood</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Hits 6 people</li>
    <li>Deals periodic damage for 8 seconds. After 8 seconds, detonates for heavy damage and hurts everyone within 11 yards</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players targeted with Cursed Blood should run to the edges of the chamber and spread out to avoid hitting other players.</p>
  <p>Use defensive cooldowns to mitigate detonation damage</p>

<h1>Ursoc</h1>
<p><i>Use Heroism at 30% health.</i></p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h3>Focused Gaze</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Targets random non-tank raid member</li>
  <li>After 6 seconds, Ursoc charges</li>
  <li>Further away the target is, the less damage they will take</li>
  <li>When Ursoc reaches his target, the entire raid will be damaged</li>
  <li>Raid damage is reduced by the # of people that Ursoc runs through to reach his target</li>
  <li>People he runs through get a Momentum debuff that will make a second run through fatal</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll split the raid into 2 groups so we don't have people getting 2 stacks of Momentum.</p>
<p>Mark a place for the Focused Gaze target to run</p>
<p>Each soak group alternates getting in the way of the charge</p>
<p>If you're not in the soak group that is going next, be to the side of Ursoc so you don't get hit accidentally</p>
<p>Healers use cooldowns after each AOE</p>

<h3>Roaring Cacophony</h3>
<ul>
  <li>High damage split between players within 25 yards</li>
  <li>Will be cast twice in a row, 10 seconds apart</li>
</ul>

<p>Healers top off raid between casts</p>

<h3>Overwhelm &amp; Rend Flesh</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tanks should not have both these debuffs at once</li>
  <li>Overwhelm increases all physical damage and stacks. Also increases the Rend Flesh bleed</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically between Overwhelm casts, the other tank should taunt to take the bleed. Then the first tank taunts back to get 2nd stack of Overwhelm.</p>
<p>When Tank 2's bleed falls off, they taunt and will take overwhelm.</p>
<p>Use cooldowns to mitigate</p>

<h3>Blood Frenzy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Starts at 30%</li>
  <li>Increased melee attack speed</li>
</ul>

<p>Use personal defensive cooldowns. DPS cooldowns. Burn the boss. Tanks should save their strongest cooldowns for Roaring Cacophony while debuffed with Overwhelm.</p>
