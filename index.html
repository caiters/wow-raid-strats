  <p>Note: Infested stacks will not be a thing for normal. Neither will the tail swipe.</p>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>

  <h3>Phase 1 ("Plagued Dreamer")</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Roughly 90 seconds long.</li>
    <li>Nythendra attacks the party until she runs out of energy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Infested Ground</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pools on the ground, created by most of Nythendra's abilities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don't stand in it.</p>

  <h4>Rot</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Debuff placed on random players</li>
    <li>Occurs roughly every 15 seconds</li>
    <li>Lasts 9 seconds. For the duration, deals periodic damage to all allies within 8 years of the afflicted player.</li>
    <li>When Rot expires, a pool of Infested Ground will be left on the ground beaneath the afflicted player.</li>
    <li>This mechanic is part of the soft enrage and will affect more players as the fight goes on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>My speculation: Players should be relatively spread out so when Rot goes out, damage is not crazy. Probably don't necessarily need to be 8 yards apart but shouldn't have more than another person or two near you probably. I don't know how easy it will be to spread out with 30 people within 1/4 of the room.</i></p>
  <p>Afflicted players must get out of the ground and go to the edge of the room by the time their debuff expires.</p>
  <p>We want to drop Rot in the current quadrant we're in (more under Infested Breath) so don't run too far away. Just get to the edge of the room.</p>

  <h4>Volatile Rot</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Debuff which is cast on Nythendra's current tank.</li>
    <li>Will occur roughly 3 times per Phase 1</li>
    <li>Lasts for 8 seconds - has no effect until it expires</li>
    <li>When the debuff expires, Volatile Rot causes an explosion damaging the entire raid. It inflicts more damage the closer you are to the center (the tank)</li>
    <li>When the debuff expires, Volatile Rot will also leave 3 Infested Ground pools near the tank.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Assign a place for Volatile Rot to be dropped that will be used throughout the fight which will be some distance from the boss (so it is not so close to the raid that it will get people killed when it detonates).</p>
  <p>When a tank is affected by Volatile Rot, the other tank should taunt. As soon as the other tank has taunted, the afflicted tank should move to the assigned location.</p>
  <p>The afflicted tank will always take full damage from the blast, so it's a good opportunity to use a cooldown.</p>

  <h4>Infested Breath</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the ability that controls Nythendra's Phase 1 to Phase 2 transition. Each cast consumes 50 energy. Transition to Phase 2 will happen after the second cast.</li>
    <li>Infested Breath will be targeted at a random raid member.</li>
    <li>Cone shape damage dealt over a 5 second channel</li>
    <li>Patches of Infested Ground will appear within the damaged cone area</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Run out of the affected area.</p>
  <p>We'll have 4 quadrants. Players will start in one, dropping Rot toward the edge of the room and clumped together for Breath. After the first Breath, will move to another quadrant.</p>
  <p>After the second breath, players will move to the other half of the room, which should be completely clear of Infested Ground.</p>
  <p>Players should be around melee range (but still spread out for Rot) so they can more easily escape the affected area. After each breath, the raid should move as a unit in the same direction (either clockwise or counterclockwise).</p>
  <p>The 2nd Infested Breath (near end of Phase 1) will coincide with the 3rd Volatile Rot on the tank, so this can be a good time to use healer cooldowns due to heavy raid damage.</p>
  <p>Ideally during phase 1 we'll keep half the room clear and concentrate the Infested Ground in the other half, so phase 2 will have half the room clear, making it easier to see bugs etc.</p>


  <h3>Phase 2 ("Heart of the Swarm")</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Begins when Nythendra reaches 0 energy.</li>
    <li>Boss no longer directly attacks group</li>
    <li>Room fills with tiny bugs (they don't do anything yet)</li>
    <li>Boss behinds to absorb Infested Ground. Infested Ground will travel toward the boss</li>
    <li>Lasts approximately 20 seconds</li>
    <li>When energy is full, go back to Phase 1</li>
    <li>After each Phase 2, 1 additional player will be affected by Rot per cast.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Infested Ground</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pools of Infested Ground from phase 1 will be drawn toward Nythendra.</li>
    <li>Infested Ground has the same effects as before (deals damage to anyone standing inside), it's just now moving toward the boss instead of being stationary</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players should not stand in the path of Infested Ground.</p>
  <p>Ideally Infested Ground has been placed around the room such that there are completely clear areas for players to stand, so they only have to worry about dodging bugs and not Infested Ground.</p>

  <h4>Corrupted Vermin</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Periodically, a handful of insects will grow and become Corrupted Vermin</li>
    <li>Fully grown insects will cast Burst of Corruption 3 times, dealing damage to players within 8 yards</li>
    <li>Players struck by Burst of Corruption will get a debuff that increases the damage they take from subsequent Bursts of Corruption</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players should watch for insects that begin to grow and get away from them before they burst.</p>

  <h3>Enrage?</h3>
  <p>There's no enrage, but each Heart of the Swarm phase will cause the next Plagued Dreamer phase to be a little more difficult, acting as a soft enrage.</p>

  <p>Note: Infested stacks will not be a thing for normal. Neither will the tail swipe.</p>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>

  <p>Elerethe will switch between forms each time her energy bar fills up.</p>

  <h3>Throughout the fight</h3>
  <h4>Pulsing Egg Sacs</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Getting too close will cause Violent Rupture, dealing damage and knocking players back</li>
    <li>Spiderlings will spawn from ruptured egg sacs and attack nearby players</li>
    <li>These spiderlings do not create venomous pools when they die</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Try not to step on them. If they are stepped on, tanks should try to pick up the spiderlings and healers should top off those who were damaged by the rupture.</p>

  <h4>Web Bridges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Stepping on a bridge will spawn a Venomous Spiderling</li>
    <li>Stacks a dot on the tank (high dmg) and creates venomous pools when they die. Venomous pools can stack and be deceptively high damage</li>
    <li>Must travel along these (and spawn a spiderling) when Elerethe changes platforms</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don't get on the web bridge unless you need to. Don't stand in pools.</p>

  <h3>Phase 1 (Spider)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lasts 90 seconds</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Web of Pain</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Links 2 players together.</li>
    <li>Lasts 90 seconds</li>
    <li>Always hits 2 tanks. Second web of pain will hit two random non-tanks.</li>
    <li>Causes linked players to reflect damage to their partner</li>
    <li>100% of damage is transferred when players are within 20 yards. If players are not within 20 yards of each other, it will deal more damage!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Linked players should stand close together to keep damage down.</p>

  <h4>Necrotic Venom</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Targets 2 random non-tank players and draws 7 yd radius around players feet</li>
    <li>This debuff does nothing for the first 10 seconds. After first 10 seconds, get new debuff that lasts 6 seconds.</li>
    <li>6 second debuff will deal damage to the target every second and to players within the 7 yard radius</li>
    <li>Affected player will drop Venomous Pool at their feet immediately and every second until debuff expires</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During the warning debuff, move away from the raid toward the edge of the platform.</p>
  <p>During the real debuff, use a defensive cooldown and keep moving to avoid standing in pools.</p>
  <p>Be careful not to drop pools in the raid's path between platforms</p>
  <p>Players with this debuff will need additional healing</p>

  <h4>Vile Ambush</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2x per spider phase, Elerethe retreats and summons Venomous Spiderlings</li>
    <li>The location of a random ranged character will be marked with an impact point</li>
    <li>After 8 seconds, she drops back down at the chosen impact point, damaging all players. Players further from impact suffer less damage. Players inside impact point may die and will be knocked back.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When Elerethe retreats and the impact point is chosen, players should run to opposite side of platform.</p>
  <p>Tanks need to pick up the spiderlings as they land.</p>
  <p>Healers should use raid cooldowns to heal Vile Ambush damage.</p>

  <h3>"Interlude"</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This lasts from the time Elerethe transforms into a Rock to when players reach her new platform.</li>
    <li>Raid will take heavy damage until they reach Elerethe</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Save healing/defensive cooldowns for this phase if possible</p>

  <h3>Phase 2 (Roc)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lasts 2 minutes</li>
    <li>Upon transforming, Elerethe will fly to a new platform</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Twisting Shadows</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Similar to Necrotic Venom - 10 second warning debuff to start</li>
    <li>During warning debuff, players are immune to Venomous Pools and they can destroy Venomous Pools by running over them</li>
    <li>When debuff wears off, a tornado spawns at the player's location. Tornadoes will wander in the area they were dropped.</li>
    <li>Players who are struck by a tornado will be stunned, take periodic damage, and will be thrown. They may take falling damage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Drop tornadoes away from the path to the next platform</p>

  <h4>Gathering Clouds</h4>
