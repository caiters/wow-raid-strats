  <p>Note: Infested stacks will not be a thing for normal. Neither will the tail swipe.</p>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>

  <h3>Phase 1 ("Plagued Dreamer")</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Roughly 90 seconds long.</li>
    <li>Nythendra attacks the party until she runs out of energy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Infested Ground</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pools on the ground, created by most of Nythendra's abilities.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don't stand in it.</p>

  <h4>Rot</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Debuff placed on random players</li>
    <li>Occurs roughly every 15 seconds</li>
    <li>Lasts 9 seconds. For the duration, deals periodic damage to all allies within 8 years of the afflicted player.</li>
    <li>When Rot expires, a pool of Infested Ground will be left on the ground beaneath the afflicted player.</li>
    <li>This mechanic is part of the soft enrage and will affect more players as the fight goes on.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>My speculation: Players should be relatively spread out so when Rot goes out, damage is not crazy. Probably don't necessarily need to be 8 yards apart but shouldn't have more than another person or two near you probably. I don't know how easy it will be to spread out with 30 people within 1/4 of the room.</i></p>
  <p>Afflicted players must get out of the ground and go to the edge of the room by the time their debuff expires.</p>
  <p>We want to drop Rot in the current quadrant we're in (more under Infested Breath) so don't run too far away. Just get to the edge of the room.</p>

  <h4>Volatile Rot</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Debuff which is cast on Nythendra's current tank.</li>
    <li>Will occur roughly 3 times per Phase 1</li>
    <li>Lasts for 8 seconds - has no effect until it expires</li>
    <li>When the debuff expires, Volatile Rot causes an explosion damaging the entire raid. It inflicts more damage the closer you are to the center (the tank)</li>
    <li>When the debuff expires, Volatile Rot will also leave 3 Infested Ground pools near the tank.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Assign a place for Volatile Rot to be dropped that will be used throughout the fight which will be some distance from the boss (so it is not so close to the raid that it will get people killed when it detonates).</p>
  <p>When a tank is affected by Volatile Rot, the other tank should taunt. As soon as the other tank has taunted, the afflicted tank should move to the assigned location.</p>
  <p>The afflicted tank will always take full damage from the blast, so it's a good opportunity to use a cooldown.</p>

  <h4>Infested Breath</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This is the ability that controls Nythendra's Phase 1 to Phase 2 transition. Each cast consumes 50 energy. Transition to Phase 2 will happen after the second cast.</li>
    <li>Infested Breath will be targeted at a random raid member.</li>
    <li>Cone shape damage dealt over a 5 second channel</li>
    <li>Patches of Infested Ground will appear within the damaged cone area</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Run out of the affected area.</p>
  <p>We'll have 4 quadrants. Players will start in one, dropping Rot toward the edge of the room and clumped together for Breath. After the first Breath, will move to another quadrant.</p>
  <p>After the second breath, players will move to the other half of the room, which should be completely clear of Infested Ground.</p>
  <p>Players should be around melee range (but still spread out for Rot) so they can more easily escape the affected area. After each breath, the raid should move as a unit in the same direction (either clockwise or counterclockwise).</p>
  <p>The 2nd Infested Breath (near end of Phase 1) will coincide with the 3rd Volatile Rot on the tank, so this can be a good time to use healer cooldowns due to heavy raid damage.</p>
  <p>Ideally during phase 1 we'll keep half the room clear and concentrate the Infested Ground in the other half, so phase 2 will have half the room clear, making it easier to see bugs etc.</p>


  <h3>Phase 2 ("Heart of the Swarm")</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Begins when Nythendra reaches 0 energy.</li>
    <li>Boss no longer directly attacks group</li>
    <li>Room fills with tiny bugs (they don't do anything yet)</li>
    <li>Boss behinds to absorb Infested Ground. Infested Ground will travel toward the boss</li>
    <li>Lasts approximately 20 seconds</li>
    <li>When energy is full, go back to Phase 1</li>
    <li>After each Phase 2, 1 additional player will be affected by Rot per cast.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Infested Ground</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Pools of Infested Ground from phase 1 will be drawn toward Nythendra.</li>
    <li>Infested Ground has the same effects as before (deals damage to anyone standing inside), it's just now moving toward the boss instead of being stationary</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players should not stand in the path of Infested Ground.</p>
  <p>Ideally Infested Ground has been placed around the room such that there are completely clear areas for players to stand, so they only have to worry about dodging bugs and not Infested Ground.</p>

  <h4>Corrupted Vermin</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Periodically, a handful of insects will grow and become Corrupted Vermin</li>
    <li>Fully grown insects will cast Burst of Corruption 3 times, dealing damage to players within 8 yards</li>
    <li>Players struck by Burst of Corruption will get a debuff that increases the damage they take from subsequent Bursts of Corruption</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players should watch for insects that begin to grow and get away from them before they burst.</p>

  <h3>Enrage?</h3>
  <p>There's no enrage, but each Heart of the Swarm phase will cause the next Plagued Dreamer phase to be a little more difficult, acting as a soft enrage.</p>

  </figure>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>

  <p>Elerethe will switch between forms each time her energy bar fills up.</p>

  <h3>Throughout the fight</h3>
  <h4>Pulsing Egg Sacs</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Getting too close will cause Violent Rupture, dealing damage and knocking players back</li>
    <li>Spiderlings will spawn from ruptured egg sacs and attack nearby players</li>
    <li>These spiderlings do not create venomous pools when they die</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Try not to step on them. If they are stepped on, tanks should try to pick up the spiderlings and healers should top off those who were damaged by the rupture.</p>

  <h4>Web Bridges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Each player stepping on a bridge will spawn a Venomous Spiderling</li>
    <li>Must travel along these (and spawn a spiderling) when Elerethe changes platforms</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Don't get on the web bridge unless it's during the Interlude. Don't stand in pools.</p>

  <h4>Venomous Spiderling</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Stacks a dot on the tank (high dmg) and creates venomous pools when they die. Venomous pools can stack on top of each other and be deceptively high damage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Offtank will pick these up and should make sure to get them out of the raid before they die. Ideally we want them to be in a place where they will not be in the path the raid has to run to get to a web bridge.</p>

  <h3>Phase 1 (Spider)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lasts 90 seconds</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Web of Pain</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Links 2 players together.</li>
    <li>Lasts 90 seconds</li>
    <li>Always hits 2 tanks. Second web of pain will hit two random non-tanks.</li>
    <li>Causes linked players to reflect damage to their partner</li>
    <li>100% of damage is transferred when players are within 20 yards. If players are not within 20 yards of each other, it will deal more damage!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Linked players should stand close together to keep damage down.</p>

  <h4>Necrotic Venom</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Targets 2 random non-tank players and draws 7 yd radius around players feet</li>
    <li>This debuff does nothing for the first 10 seconds. After first 10 seconds, get new debuff that lasts 6 seconds.</li>
    <li>6 second debuff will deal damage to the target every second and to players within the 7 yard radius</li>
    <li>Affected player will drop Venomous Pool at their feet immediately and every second until debuff expires</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During the warning debuff, move away from the raid toward the edge of the platform.</p>
  <p>During the real debuff, use a defensive cooldown and keep moving to avoid standing in pools.</p>
  <p>Be careful not to drop pools in the raid's path between platforms</p>
  <p>Players with this debuff will need additional healing</p>

  <h4>Vile Ambush</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>2x per spider phase, Elerethe retreats and summons Venomous Spiderlings</li>
    <li>The location of a random ranged character will be marked with an impact point</li>
    <li>After 8 seconds, she drops back down at the chosen impact point, damaging all players. Players further from impact suffer less damage. Players inside impact point may die and will be knocked back.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tanks should be tanking spider form Elerethe at one side of the platform. Ideally at the end of spider phase you'd like her to be near the next platform she'll travel to. (Is this always the same platform?)</p>
  <p>When Elerethe retreats and the impact point is chosen, players should run to opposite side of platform. The idea is for each Vile Ambush you'll just swap positions.</p>
  <p>Tanks need to pick up the spiderlings as they land.</p>
  <p>Healers should use raid cooldowns to heal Vile Ambush damage.</p>

  <h3>Phase 2 (Roc)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lasts 2 minutes</li>
    <li>Elerethe turns into a bird</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Twisting Shadows</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Similar to Necrotic Venom - 10 second warning debuff to start</li>
    <li>During warning debuff, players are immune to Venomous Pools and they can destroy Venomous Pools by running over them</li>
    <li>When debuff wears off, a tornado spawns at the player's location. Tornadoes will wander in the area they were dropped.</li>
    <li>Players who are struck by a tornado will be stunned, take periodic damage, and will be thrown. They may take falling damage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players should absorb Venomous Pools to clean up platform</p>
  <p>Drop tornadoes away from the path to the next platform in a safe place.</p>

  <h4>Gathering Clouds</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Deals raid-wide damage and pushes players back</li>
    <li>After it completes, Elerethe will fly to the next platform</li>
    <li>Elerethe flying to new platform begins the Interlude phase</li>
    <li>Elerethe drops Shimmering Feathers on the ground after taking off</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Avoid being pushed into venomous pools, twisting shadows, egg sacs, or off the edge. If possible stand with your back to the wall to avoid pushback and continue to heal/dps.</p>
  <p>Good time to use raid wide damage reduction and healing cooldowns</p>

  <h3>"Interlude"</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Elerethe flies to a new platform</li>
    <li>Dark Storm debuff affects the two platforms Elerethe is not on</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Dark Storm</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Deals raidwide damage to anyone who is not on Elerethe's current platform</li>
    <li>Damage starts low and ramps up 5% per stack</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Get out of Dark Storm asap by getting to Elerethe's new platform.</p>
  <p>If you don't take a Shimmering Feather, this is a good time to use personal defensive cooldowns.</p>
  <p>Speed boosts can be useful but also deadly, use with caution</p>

  <h4>Web Bridges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Each player that crosses will spawn 1 spiderling</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Watch out for Twisting Shadows when crossing. You may need to drop to a lower web bridge to avoid them.</p>
  <p>Survival is more important than speed.</p>
  <p>Ground tank should pick up spiderlings and when they get to the other end of the bridge, should drag them away from the raid. Let's say after they get off bridge, they go to the right of the bridge.</p>
  <p>Be very careful not to trigger any egg sacs while crossing</p>

  <h4>Shimmering Feathers</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Each one can only be taken by 1 raid member</li>
    <li>Lasts 25 seconds</li>
    <li>Allows the player to leap into the sky and applies slow fall debuff so they can glide over gap between platforms</li>
    <li>Player can jump multiple times from the ground (but cannot jump while in midair)</li>
    <li>Grants extra action button that allows the player to target a spot on the ground to land, killing any Venomous Spiderlings in 9 yards</li>
  </ul>
  <p>1 tank, 1+ healers, and the rest DPS should be assigned to take feathers. They will jump directly to Elerethe's platform.</p>
  <p>Once on Elerethe's platform, when the offtank arrives with the spiders, DPS with feathers should focus on killing the Venomous Spiderlings. (Tank and healer will deal with boss)</p>
  <p>Note that spiderlings killed in this fashion still drop Venomous Pools, so don't block the raid's path across the bridge</p>

  <h3>Roc Form Still</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Elerethe will remain in this form until she reaches 100 energy, at which point she turns into a spider again.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During this part of the fight, the tanks should slowly drag Elerethe across the platform to the other bridge in order to keep the raid away from tornadoes.</p>

  <h4>Raking Talons</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Cast 3 times, 33 seconds apart</li>
    <li>Each cast will involve 2 strikes of Raking talons, which will be 3 seconds apart</li>
    <li>If a tank is struck by both strikes in a single cast, second strike will deal 100% additional damage</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tanks should taunt after the first strike of Raking Talons to avoid the stacking damage.</p>
  <p>Tanks should mitigate this damage with cooldowns or active mitigation</p>

  <h4>Razor Wing</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Cast immediately after Raking Talons</li>
    <li>Deals damage in a cone in front of boss</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tanks should keep the boss pointed away from the raid. Melee and offtank should not stand in front of the boss.</p>

  <h2>Abilities</h2>

  <h3>Phase 1 ("The Ruined Ground")</h3>
  <p>Goal is to defeat the Eye of Il'gynoth in order to access the heart.</p>

  <h4>Nightmare Gaze</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Eye will target a random raid member. Cannot avoid, so just keep the raid topped up.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Adds</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Large adds (Tentacles &amp; Horror) need to be killed. When killed, they will spawn varying numbers of Nightmare Ichor (1-4 depending on the mob).</li>
    <li>Nightmare Ichor will fixate a random raid member</li>
    <li>When Nightmare Ichor is killed, its Nightmare Explosion will deal AoE damage around it after 2.5s. If within 15 yards of the Eye, will deal 5% of the Eye's health.</li>
    <li>Nightmare Ichor will apply a stack of Touch of Corruption on melee attacks. It can be dispeled but ideally we don't want the target being hit much</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fixated players should kite the Ichor to the Eye.</p>
  <p>DPS should switch to the Ichor and kill it when it is within 15 yards of the Eye</p>
  <p>Do not stun Ichor unless it's already in range of the Eye. Ichors can be slowed, particularly to help reduce their debuff stacks on their target.</p>
  <p>Get away from the Ichor before it explodes to avoid being damaged</p>
  <p>Need to kill 20 Nightmare Ichor near the Eye to enter Phase 2.</p>
  <p>When the eye is killed, no more adds will be spawned. Finish off the remaining adds before entering the heart chamber.</p>
  <p><strong>Corruptor Tentacles > Ichor (in range) &gt; Other Tentacles &gt; Horror</strong></p>

  <h5>Dominator Tentacle</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Must be tanked and must have someone in melee range</li>
    <li>Deal heavy damage - use cooldowns or active mitigation to survive</li>
    <li>Will randomly target players for Ground Slam (typically melee). This effect is on the player, not on the ground. After 2 seconds, the attack hits.</li>
    <li>Ground Slam deals damage in a cone and knocks back</li>
    <li>On death, spawns 2 Nightmare Ichor.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We want to assign at least 1 melee to each Dominator Tentacle to make sure they are the ones targeted for Ground Slam. Can be difficult for ranged to escape it.</p>
  <p>If the target is near other players they need to get away from other players in their 2 seconds</p>

  <h5>Deathglare Tentacle</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Does not need to be tanked</li>
    <li>Randomly targets raid member with Mind Flay</li>
    <li>Can be interrupted and stunned</li>
    <li>Spawns 2 Nightmare Ichor</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Low health players targeted with Mind Flay should use cooldowns</p>
  <p>Ideally we want to interrupt every cast</p>

  <h5>Nightmare Horror</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Must be tanked</li>
    <li>Every 10 seconds, casts Eye of Fate dealing damage in a straight line in front of the mob. Eye of Fate stacks.</li>
    <li>Spawns 4 Nightmare Ichor</li>
    <li>Creates Nightmare Corruption pools under its feet every 5 sec which causes damage and pacifies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Tanks swap on 3 stacks of Eye of Fate. Tanks should use strong mitigation to survive the 3rd one. Tank facing away from the raid.</p>
  <p>Tank needs to move the Nightmare Horror away from the pools so melee won't stand in it</p>
  <p>Low priority kill target so can be good to keep near tentacles for cleave. Just don't drop nightmare corruption on the melee</p>

  <h5>Corruptor Tentacle</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Targets random non-tanks for Spew Corruption - deals instant damage and debuffs</li>
    <li>Debuff will deal periodic damage and create Nightmare Corruption beneath affected player's feet</li>
    <li>Spawns 1 Nightmare Ichor</li>
    <li>Kill these first!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players targeted should move to the outer edge, dropping all 4 pools before returning to the group.</p>
  <p>Try to drop pools so they overlap (pools will slowly grow), and stay in range of healers. Use damage reduction cooldown if possible.</p>
  <p>DO NOT be near the eye with your pools because that can screw over our ability to kill Ichor. If you are fixated, wait until your corruption debuff fades before kiting Ichor to boss</p>

  <h3>Phase 2 ("The Heart of Corruption")</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>(1st time) Players have 50 seconds to deal as much damage as possible to the heart. After 50 seconds are up, any players still in the heart chamber are insta-killed and we return to Phase 1.</li>
    <li>(2nd time) Players have 90 seconds to deal as much damage as possible to the heart. After 90 seconds are up, the raid will be wiped.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Plan to leave the chamber when about 5 seconds are left remaining on the cast. Earlier if you have lag issues.</p>
  <p>Use Heroism once people are inside and blow dps cooldowns.</p>
  <p>Nothing to tank so tanks can deal damage during this phase</p>

  <h4>Cursed Blood</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Hits 6 people</li>
    <li>Deals periodic damage for 8 seconds. After 8 seconds, detonates for heavy damage and hurts everyone within 11 yards</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Players targeted with Cursed Blood should run to the edges of the chamber and spread out to avoid hitting other players.</p>
  <p>Use defensive cooldowns to mitigate detonation damage</p>

<h1>Ursoc</h1>
<p><i>Use Heroism at 30% health.</i></p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h3>Focused Gaze</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Targets random non-tank raid member</li>
  <li>After 6 seconds, Ursoc charges</li>
  <li>Further away the target is, the less damage they will take</li>
  <li>When Ursoc reaches his target, the entire raid will be damaged</li>
  <li>Raid damage is reduced by the # of people that Ursoc runs through to reach his target</li>
  <li>People he runs through get a Momentum debuff that will make a second run through fatal</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll split the raid into 2 groups so we don't have people getting 2 stacks of Momentum.</p>
<p>Mark a place for the Focused Gaze target to run</p>
<p>Each soak group alternates getting in the way of the charge</p>
<p>If you're not in the soak group that is going next, be to the side of Ursoc so you don't get hit accidentally</p>
<p>Healers use cooldowns after each AOE</p>

<h3>Roaring Cacophony</h3>
<ul>
  <li>High damage split between players within 25 yards</li>
  <li>Will be cast twice in a row, 10 seconds apart</li>
</ul>

<p>Healers top off raid between casts</p>

<h3>Overwhelm &amp; Rend Flesh</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tanks should not have both these debuffs at once</li>
  <li>Overwhelm increases all physical damage and stacks. Also increases the Rend Flesh bleed</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically between Overwhelm casts, the other tank should taunt to take the bleed. Then the first tank taunts back to get 2nd stack of Overwhelm.</p>
<p>When Tank 2's bleed falls off, they taunt and will take overwhelm.</p>
<p>Use cooldowns to mitigate</p>

<h3>Blood Frenzy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Starts at 30%</li>
  <li>Increased melee attack speed</li>
</ul>

<p>Use personal defensive cooldowns. DPS cooldowns. Burn the boss. Tanks should save their strongest cooldowns for Roaring Cacophony while debuffed with Overwhelm.</p>

<h1>Dragons of Nightmare</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Dragons with a shared health pool</li>
  <li>We only ever fight 2 at a time - one is always Ysondre</li>
  <li>So we'll fight 3 total dragons. It's random each week</li>
  <li>We'll split the raid into 2 groups. You will stay on your side of the room and will not move with your target. Groups must stay very far apart.</li>

<h1>Cenarius</h1>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>Cenarius has 2 phases. During phase 1, he'll spawn waves of adds every ~80 seconds or so (when he reaches full energy). Phase 2 will begin when Cenarius summons the 6th wave of adds or hits 35% health. Use Heroism at the beginning of Phase 2, after adds are killed (if there are any up).</p>
<p>Try not to push Cenarius to Phase 2 while there are still adds alive, seeds are up, or when he is at 100 energy</p>

<h3>Creeping Nightmare</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stacking debuff applied every 2 seconds. Damage taken by it is increased per stack</li>
  <li>Cleared by Cleansed Ground</li>
</ul>
<p>Players should reset their stacks by stepping into Cleansed Ground</p>
<p>Try clearing stacks around 15-20.</p>
<p>If you have damage reduction cooldowns you might be able to let your stacks go a little higher</p>

<h3>Cleansed Ground</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cast by Malfurion</li>
  <li>Shrinks after players clear their stacks</li>
</ul>
<p>Players must quickly get out after clearing their stacks - if they stay in, every 2 seconds they will receive a new Creeping Nightmare debuff, which will be cleared by Cleansed Ground, causing it to grow smaller and essentially taking it away from someone who needs it more</p>
<p>Tanks: Do not drag the boss into Cleansed Ground</p>

<h3>Bramble Swarm</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixates a random player and creeps toward them</li>
  <li>Leaves a patch of nightmare brambles every 2 seconds</li>
  <li>Players touched by Bramble Swarm or who step into Brambles will be rooted and take heavy dot damage</li>
  <li>If Bramble Swarm reaches its target, it will choose a new target</li>
  <li>There is no in-game indicator of being fixated</li>
</ul>
<p>Players should spread out so it's more clear who the brambles are following. If you are being followed, kite it out of the raid</p>
<p>If you are rooted, use a defensive cooldown or use an ability to free yourself from the roots (any ability that unroots you)</p>
<p>Healers can dispel the root debuff to clear the root and dot</p>
<p>Once freed, move away quickly to not be rooted again</p>
<p>Divine Shield, Cloak of Shadows, and Anti-Magic Shell can be used to remove brambles. So can uses who have Unbound Touch or Unbound Essences from Redeemed Sisters (explained in a bit)</p>

<h3>Thorns Aura</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cenarius casts immediately after Forces of Nightmare spawn</li>
</ul>
<p>Cenarius has a thorns aura. Adds must be kept 20+ yards away from Cenarius so they do not gain the thorns buff. Be careful dotting him during this so you don't kill yourself</p>

<h3>Adds</h3>
<p>One tank will tank Cenarius while the other picks up adds. Tank Cenarius close to the wall. After adds are dead, tanks should swap so the Cenarius tank can clear their stacks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tormented Souls (red wisps around tree) - summons Corrupted Wisps</li>
  <li>Corrupted Emerald Egg (dragon egg) - summons Rotton Drake</li>
  <li>Corrupted Nature (swirls) - summons Twisted Sister</li>
  <li>Nightmare Sapling (tree w/o wisps) - summons Nightmare Ancient</li>
</ul>
<p>Cenarius will spawn 3 nightmare seeds at the beginning of each add phase. They will appear in predetermined places determined by which add phase it is. It will take about 15 seconds for the seeds to activate, after which Malfurion will cleanse whichever adds are summoned closest to the bulk of the group.</p>
<p>Malurion will cast Cleansing Ground beneath one of the nightmare seeds, causing the add that spawns to be friendly instead of hostile. He will cast this at the seed closest to the majority of the raid. We'll be having the raid move to a designated Seed in order to control which add Malfurion cleanses.</p>

<h4>Corrupted Wisps</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Cannot truly be tanked</li>
  <li>Target one random member of the raid - does not show a fixated indicator</li>
  <li>When they reach that person, they explode for aoe damage in 8 yards</li>
</ul>
<p>Raid should spread out a bit to make sure the explosions don't deal a ton of raid-wide damage.</p>
<p>DPS should focus down the wisps. If you are targeted, kite the wisp away from the raid.</p>
<p>Wisps can be stunned, rooted, slowed, knocked back, etc</p>
<p>It's possible for wisps to be taunted - tanks should probably not do this, but a hybrid class can taunt a wisp away from the raid</p>

<p><strong>Cleansed Wisps</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Wisps detonate to create small patches of Cleansed Ground</li>
</ul>
<p>Raid can use these small patches just like the larger one to clear their Creeping Nightmares debuff</p>

<h4>Rotten Drake</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Must be tanked</li>
  <li>Will target random person for Rotten Breath. Turns to face them and after cast, channels for 4 seconds dealing damage in a cone.</li>
  <li>At 50% health, starts dealing aoe damage to the raid with Nightmare Buffet. Nightmare Buffet dmg + breath dmg will increase per stack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Raid should stay close to the drake so it's easy to escape cone.</p>
<p>Kill it asap when it reaches 50% health</p>

<p><strong>Cleansed Emerald Drake</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Targets random tank with Ancient Dream - just like priest Guardian Spirit. Lasts 30 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>When a tank has this buff, they can taunt corrupted wisps without fear of dying</p>

<h4>Twisted Sister</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Must be tanked</li>
  <li>Will heal other enemies with Twisted Touch of Life</li>
  <li>Attacks ranged with Nightmare Javelin</li>
  <li>Targets 3 non-tanks with Scorned Touch. Slows by 30% and detonates after 12 seconds. Players struck by detonation will get Scorned Touch debuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interrupted Twisted Touch of Life. If the cast gets off, dispel the HoT component</p>
<p>Players with Scorned Touch must get out of the raid to not spread the debuff</p>
<p>Ranged should spread out to limit Nightmare Javelin damage</p>

<p><strong>Cleansed Redeemed Sister</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Buff random players with Unbound Touch - immunity to shadow damage, + movement speed. When this effect expires, it will spread Unbound Essence buff to allies within 4 yards (has same effect)</li>
</ul>
<p>Players with this buff can clear Nightmare Brambles since they are immune to shadow damage</p>

<h4>Nightmare Ancient</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Must be tanked</li>
  <li>Casts Desiccating Stomp at 100 energy. Deals heavy damage split amongst players within 8 years</li>
</ul>
<p>Raid should stack around the Ancient to split Stomp damage</p>

<p><strong>Cleansed Ancient</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Casts Replenishing Roots, restoring 45% of players' mana nearby</li>
</ul>

<h4>DPS priority</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Corrupted Wisps</li>
  <li>Twisted Sister</li>
  <li>Rotten Drake</li>
  <li>Nightmare Ancient</li>
  <li>Cenarius</li>
</ol>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>We will cleanse in this order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wisp - Fight dragon and ancient - Dodge Rotten Breath but stay close for Stomp</li>
  <li>Wisp - Spread out for Nightmare Javelin from Sister and Scorned Touch. Continue to dodge Rotten Breath</li>
  <li>Sister - Use Unbound Touch to clear Nightmare Brambles. Kill Sister then treant.</li>
  <li>Drake - Tank with Ancient Dream can round up stray wisps - don't kill melee though</li>
  <li>Treant - Stack near ancient for healer mana</li>
  <li>Wisp - Clear creeping nightmares often</li>
</ol>

<h2>Phase 2</h2>
<p>Burn phase!</p>
<p>Cenarius will cover the ground with Nightmares. This acts as the soft enrage. He will no longer use Thorns or spawn adds, but will continue to spawn Nightmare Brambles and stacking Creeping Nightmares</p>
<p>Tank should pull him to one corner of the room and slowly move him aroudn the edge when nightmare pools spawn. Try to overlap pools as much as possible to conserve space. Tank can move Cenarius to the Cleansed Ground to clear stacks and then return to edge</p>
<p>Malfurion will target largest clump of players with Cleansed Ground</p>
<p>Ranged and healers should stay away from melee to try to keep Brambles from getting into melee</p>

<h3>Spear of Nightmares</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New ability - targets current tank and deals heavy damage.</li>
  <li>Nightmares pool will spawn at tanks feet and deals damage to players inside</li>
  <li>Size of nightmares pool depends on the amount of damage the tank took from Spear</li>
  <li>Debuffs tank to take 100% more damage from Spear for 45 sec</li>
</ul>
<p>Protect the tank with heavy cooldowns from both the tank themself and healers to reduce Spear damage</p>
<p>Tanks should swap at each Spear</p>

<h3>Entangling Nightmares</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Captures Malfurion</li>
</ul>
<p>Ranged should dps this down asap. Melee stay on Cenarius if Malfurion is in Nightmares</p>

<h1>Xavius</h1>
<p>This fight takes place in an area with no clear boundaries. Along the edges are The Infinite Dark. Players will take high damage if they  enter this area so they should take care to stay out.</p>
<p>Xavius has 3 phases. Phase 2 starts at 65% and Phase 3 starts at 30%. Each phase has some different mechanics.</p>

<h2>Every Phase</h2>
<p>When Xavius hits 100 energy, adds are spawned.</p>

<h2>Corruption</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Similar to Cho'gall in Bastion of Twilight</li>
  <li>You get additional corruption from several of Xavius's abilities</li>
  <li>At different thresholds you will begin to be affected by additional mechanics</li>
  <li>At 33 Corruption you are affected by Dread Abominations</li>
  <li><strong>Dread Abominations</strong> create large pink circles where they will slam their limb into the ground. Players are center of circle take high damage. Get as far away from this as possible.</li>
  <li>At 66 Corruption you are affected by Unfathomable Reality.</li>
  <li><strong>Unfathomable Reality</strong> causes small pink swirls in random locations. After 3 sections, flames erupt from these locations. Deal damage to people within 6 yards. Also gives +5 Corruption. Just move out of these.</li>
  <li>At 100 Corruption you are affected by Descent into Madness.</li>
  <li><strong>Descent into Madness</strong> gives the player a 150% damage and healing buff for 20 seconds. Afterward you are MC'd. MC'd players have 150% more health and are immune to all CC but stuns. MC'd players must be killed.</li>
  <li>Battle res does not clear corruption. Don't use them in MC'd players early in the fight because it will make no difference.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Dream</h2>
<p>The dream of Ysera appears twice and half the group will be sent into the Dream. One half will go the 1st time, the other half will go the 2nd time. It will appear at 95% and 60% health (start of Phase 1 and Phase 2).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Damage and corruption gained by the player is in a Dream Simulacrum is erased when the Dream ends</li>
  <li>Cooldowns (NOT HEROISM) used in the Dream are restored when the player awakens</li>
  <li>Mana spent during the Dream is refunded when they awaken</li>
  <li>Dream lasts for 3 minutes or until the player takes fatal damage or reaches 100 Corruption</li>
  <li>If players reach 100 Corruption they will benefit from the Descent into Madness buff</li>
</ul>
<p>Players are set to zero corruption in the dream, but after leaving will be back at the same corruption level they entered with.</p>
<p>Players in the Dream should assist the raid by performing tasks and soaking mechanics that cause corruption in order to shield the other raid members from corruption.</p>
<p><strong>Tanks</strong> should taunt the Corruption Horror or taunt Xavius during Nightmare Infusion</p>
<p><strong>Healers</strong> should be the primary dispellers of tank debuffs</p>
<p><strong>DPS</strong> should intercept Lurking Horrors, soak Corruption Meteors, absorb Tainted Discharge</p>
<p>Basically your goal is to stay in there as long as possible, getting as much Corruption as possible, to get the Descent into Madness buff. Use cooldowns liberally in the Dream.</p>
<p>Players in the dream are still suceptible to the Corruption mechanics at 33 and 66 corruption and need to watch out for these. Avoid taking damage and reaching 0 health in the Dream before you get your damage buff.</p>

<h2>Phase 1 - 100%-65%</h2>

<h3>Adds</h3>

<h4>Adds (General)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Summons adds at 100 energy - roughly every 20 seconds</li>
  <li>Most of the time it is a Lurking Terror</li>
  <li>3rd and 7th time at 100 energy, Xavius will cast Manifest Corruption instead.</li>
  <li>Manifest Corruption spawns a Corruption Horror and deals heavy raid-wide damage.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lurking Eruption (Lurking Terror)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Prefers ranged</li>
  <li>Will not target players in the Dream</li>
  <li>Splashes damage in 6 yards</li>
  <li>Spawns Lurking Terror - Lurking Terror fixates a target. When ANY player intercepts the Lurking Terror, it will deal damage to them and gives corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>Spread out to avoid splashing damage.</p>
<p>We'll mark a location to kite the terror toward.</p>
<p>Dream players should intercept them to prevent the corruption gain hitting other players</p>

<h4>Corruption Horror</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Must be tanked</li>
  <li>Every 20 seconds aoes, damaging all players and giving +5 corruption</li>
  <li>Every 12 seconds, casts Tormenting Swipe at target - deals heavy damage in front and gives 10 corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>Face away from raid. Dream tank should pick it up and bring it near Xavius for cleave damage. DPS should focus the Horror and kill it asap.</p>
<p>Avoid pushing to Phase 2 while this add is alive.</p>

<h3>Nightmare Blades</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Targets 2 non-tank targets every 15 seconds. Includes players in Dream.</li>
  <li>Targets get red arrow and a debuff. After 4 seconds, Nightmare Blades spawn and go in a straight line between the two players</li>
  <li>Players struck with blades will take heavy damage and be knocked back</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll mark a location for Nightmare Blades targets to run to the side of the boss so melee don't have far to run. Targets must get out of the raid.</p>

<h3>Darkening Soul</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Strikes tanks. Applies a new stack every 8-10 seconds</li>
  <li>Strong DoT effect. This is a tank swap mechanic</li>
  <li>Has no duration, can only be removed by dispels</li>
  <li>When it is dispelled, heavy damage is dealt to all players within 25 yards of tank</li>
  <li>Dispelling healer takes +25 Corruption and heavy damage</li>
</ul>
<p>Tanks should run away from the raid in order to be dispelled. We'll place a marker. Tanks should use a cooldown when dispelled.</p>
<p>Swap every 3-4 stacks. (Fatboss recommends 6 so we can see what feels good to us)</p>
<p>Dream healers should be dispelling this debuff. Each dream healer can only dispel 4 times before Dream ends due to corruption. Cycle dispelling duties so healers stay in the dream for longer.</p>
<p>If you are 2-tanking, the non-Dream tank will be taking many stacks while the Dream tank handles the Corruption Horror, so non-Dream tank should save best cooldowns for this.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if 3-tanking, other two tanks swap normally while Dream tank handles the Horror.</p>

<h2>Phase 2 - 65%-30%</h2>
<p>Try not to push Xavius to Phase 3 until all Tainted Discharge pools have been absorbed.</p>

<h3>Adds</h3>
<h4>Inconceivable Horror</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Spawns every ~40 seconds at 100 energy</li>
  <li>Number depends on raid size</li>
  <li>Horror will spawn near edge and slowly walk toward boss</li>
  <li>When it gets close, will channel Dark Ruination</li>
  <li>Dark Ruination empowers Xavius and players gain 1 Corruption per tick.</li>
  <li>When it dies, leaves a Tainted Discharge pool - After 15 seconds, spawns a new Inconceivable Horror add</li>
  <li>Players can soak the pools by standing in them. This deals some damage over time and players gain 4 corruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kill Horrors quickly and use slows, stuns, etc to keep them away from Xavius.</p>
<p>Melee and non-tanking tank should damage close Horrors, while ranged should damage further away</p>
<p>Dream players should absorb pools</p>
<p>Tank can move Xavius away from approaching Horrors if needed</p>

<h3>Corruption Meteor</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Targets random non-tank player</li>
  <li>Player marked with black arrow, red circle will show meteor radius</li>
  <li>After 5 seconds, player is struck. Deals heavy damage and +40 corruption. Damage and corruption is split evenly between players inside the area of effect</li>
</ul>
<p>Players in the dream should help spread the damage/corruption. Non-dreamers should avoid it.</p>
<p>Mark location for corruption meteor target to run to. Dream players should be nearby so they don't have to move a lot</p>

<h3>Blackening Soul</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tank debuff ability in phase 2</li>
  <li>Similar to mechanic in phase 1. Swap every 3-4 stacks.</li>
  <li>When dispelled, tank will take 150% more physical dmg for 30 seconds.</li>
  <li>Tainted discharge will appear where tank was dispelled and must be soaked</li>
  <li>Dispeller will take damage and corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>Tank should avoid Xavius' melee attacks while debuffed after the dispel</p>
<p>Dreaming healers should dispel</p>

<h3>Nightmare Infusion</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Xavius buffs himself and his melee attacks give +5 Corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>Dream tank should taunt Xavius to eat the corruption gain</p>
<p>Ideally we want to prevent Dream tank's blackening soul debuff from getting too high, so try to plan around Nightmare Infusion when doing swaps.</p>

<h2>Phase 3 - 30%-0%</h2>
<p>Burn phase. Use Heroism here.</p>

<h3>Writhing Deep</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cast at 100 energy.</li>
  <li>roughly every 20 seconds</li>
  <li>Summons Nightmare Tentacle adds that will cast Nightmare Bolt at random non-tank targets every 3 seconds. Deals damage and gives +corruption. Cannot interrupt. Immune to CC effects. Do not need to be tanked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tanks should move Xavius near the tentacles so we can cleave</p>
<p>Multi-dotting tentacles can be effective</p>
<p>Don't have to kill them all - goal is to reduce raid damage and corruption enough to avoid MC and deaths</p>

<h3>Other abilities</h3>
<p>Xavius will cast Nightmare Blades every ~33 sec and Corruption Meteor every ~45 sec.</p>
<p>Tanks will still get Blackening Soul, healers will still get debuff when dispelling, and tanks will get physical damage debuff when they are dispelled.</p>
<p>Xavius will still use Nightmare Infusion every minute</p>
<p>Raid should stack up so Corruption Meteor is spread as possible</p>
<p>Players targeted with Nightmare Blades need to move out to the side</p>
<p>Lowest Corruption healer should dispel Blackening Soul</p>
<p>Lowest Corruption tank should taunt Xavius for Nightmare Infusion</p>
<p>Players who get Descent into Madness should do as much damage as possible to Xavius before they are MC'd. At that point raid must decide to kill them or stun/etc</p>
